SUPPORT FOR THE FAIR PRINCIPLES

The FAIR principles are considered a gold standard for research data management. In this work, we follow best practices for improving the support for them in the HIHISIV database. For improving findability, basic metadata using schema.org was added to the headers of the HIHISIV web page, allowing for indexing by search engines and dataset repositories. HIHISIV data and metadata are openly accessible through its URL (https://hihisiv.github.io) using the HTTP protocol. When applicable, terms used both in the database schema and in its web interface follow Gene Ontology (12), improving interoperability. For better reusability, the database contains references to the original data used in the analyses. The source code for the analysis workflows, the database schema and initialization scripts, and the web application is available on [Github](https://github.com/quelopes/hihisiv). This script describes v1.0.0 of the database, which is archived on Zenodo under DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7093185.
